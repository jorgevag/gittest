[Squashing Commits](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5308816/how-to-use-git-merge-squash)

  commit clean and as it is supposed to be.
  More on this behaviour on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25939329/why-are-unstaged-changes-still-present-after-checking-out-a-different-branch)
